Inferring Grain Size Distribution from Magnetic Hysteresis

We present a physics-informed inverse framework that enables quantitative inference of grain-size statistics directly from magnetic hysteresis loops, providing a non-destructive alternative to microscopy-based microstructural characterization. Unlike imaging techniques, which probe limited sample volumes and are sensitive to segmentation bias, hysteresis measurements encode the collective response of the full grain ensemble and therefore contain recoverable information about underlying size dispersion and reversal dynamics. We model grain formation as a stochastic nucleation-growth process whose stationary outcome is a Modified Lognormal Power-law distribution, capturing both the dominant grain population and rare overgrowth events. By mapping this distribution into coercivity space through Brown's relation and embedding it within a dynamic magnetization model, we derive a forward description linking microstructural statistics to hysteresis behavior. The inverse problem is solved via nonlinear optimization, allowing joint estimation of the grain-size distribution parameters and the critical single-domain radius directly from hysteresis data. Applications to hard, soft, and composite ferrite systems show that the inferred parameters are physically interpretable and consistent with independent microstructural observations, while revealing systematic differences in growth arrest and dynamic reversal across material classes. These results demonstrate that magnetic hysteresis loops provide a viable quantitative probe of grain-scale structure and evolution.
